# De novo short-range template switching events
This repo contains a follow up work on short-range template switching events described in [LÃ¶ytynoja & Goldman (2017)](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/27/6/1039) and in [Walker, et. al (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1009221) 

We used 602 high coverage mother-father-child trio genomes and state of art variant callers to discover de novo mutations of this kind.
